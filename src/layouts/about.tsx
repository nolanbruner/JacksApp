                <br /><div>Our services are simple.  Hydroseeding.  We work with you directly to find the best mixture for your project. </div>
                <br />
                <div>Hydroseeding is a method of planting grass or other seeds that involves spraying a mixture of seed, fertilizer, mulch, and water onto the soil. It's often used to quickly and efficiently establish vegetation on large areas, such as lawns, slopes, or construction sites. The mixture is called a slurry.</div>
                {/* <div>HPH was started to fill a growing void in the landscape and turf industry in the area.  Our division is headed by Jack Mazza.
